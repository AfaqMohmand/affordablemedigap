          <p> Each plan fills a different amount of holes left by Medicare coverage. As a result, selecting one of these plans would provide cover for part or all of Medicare gaps. Please be careful not to confuse these plans with an Affordable Medicare advantage plan, which provides coverage for more information on Medicare advantage plans.</p>
                    
                    <p>Medigap plans are essentially the same regardless of the provider you enroll with. A Medigap plan could be the way to go if you need coverage support â€“ but which one? Here's a rundown of all you need to know regarding the Plans.</p>
                   
                    <h3 style="font-size:40px; font-weight:300; color:#9BCC4E;">  Medigap</h3>
                    <p>Though Original Medicare, which comprises Parts A and B, covers most health care services, Medigap coverage can help with deductibles, copay, and coinsurance. This coverage is in addition to Original Medicare (Medicare Parts A and B). It expands on the coverage offered by Original Medicare.</p>
                    <p>Long-term care, dental treatment, eye care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and personal nursing are not covered by Medigap policies. Prescription drugs are typically not covered by most policies.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size:40px; font-weight:300; color:#9BCC4E;">  Medigap Policies</h3>
            <p>Medigap insurance has a monthly premium. A Medigap coverage only insures one individual. If you and your partner both desire a Medigap policy, you must purchase one for each of you.</p>
            <p>Medigap policies are only provided to individuals that already have Medicare Part A, which includes paying for hospital services, and Medicare Part B, which covers the cost of medical services. People that have a Medicare Advantage plan are not eligible for a Medigap plan.</p>
            <p>If you want to get a Medigap plan, you have six months after the first day of the month of your 65th birthday to do so, as provided as you have been also signed up for Medicare Part B or are all within six months of registering for Medicare Part B.</p>
            <p>You pay a monthly premium to the private insurer or insurance company for your Medigap coverage. This monthly premium is added to the Part B premium you spend to Medicare.</p>
            <p>A Medigap coverage can be acquired from any insurance company that is licensed to sell them in your state.</p>
            <p>Regardless of whether you have health issues, any standardized Medigap coverage is guaranteed to renew. This implies that as long as you pay your premiums, the insurance company cannot terminate your Medigap policy.</p>
            <p>If you get Medigap and Medicare prescription coverage from the same company, you must be required to pay two different premiums. </p>
            <p>If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan, it is prohibited for everyone to sell you a Medigap policy unless you are moving back to Original Medicare.</p>
